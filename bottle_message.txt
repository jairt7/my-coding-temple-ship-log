I made some mistakes with this. Sorry. In my defense, the video tutorial with complete instructions was only presented after some slides with incomplete instructions.
But it's good to remember mistakes so we can learn from them. So I'm leaving the "Added" message alone. Not because I don't know how to fix it. Nope.
